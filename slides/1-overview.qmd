MLflow is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle


## Tracking experiments

- Tracking experiments to record and compare parameters and results (MLflow Tracking).

## Packaging ML code

- Packaging ML code in a reusable, reproducible form in order to share with other data scientists or transfer to production (MLflow Projects).

## Managing and deploying models

- Managing and deploying models from a variety of ML libraries to a variety of model serving and inference platforms (MLflow Models).

## Model registry

- Providing a central model store to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model, including model versioning, stage transitions, and annotations (MLflow Model Registry).
