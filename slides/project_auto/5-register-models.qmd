# Python setup

```{python}

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import mlflow.pyfunc
import mlflow

from pathlib import Path

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score

```


```{python}
# Load and split the dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)


```

# MLflow Model Lifecycle Stages


## Overview

- Organize, manage, and deploy models effectively
- Track the progression of models through their lifecycle

## Primary Stages

- After a run was successful, you can register the model in the MLflow Model Registry  

---

### None

- Initial stage for newly registered model versions
- No specific stage assigned yet

---

### Staging

- Models undergoing testing, validation, or review
- Not yet ready for production deployment
- Preparing for production use

---

### Production

- Models ready for deployment in production environments
- Passed all tests and validations
- Expected to perform well when deployed

---

### Archived

- Model versions no longer in active use
- Declutters the model registry
- Focuses on models currently in use



# Model Staging Steps

## Overview

- Validate and test the model before promoting to production
- Ensure model meets desired performance criteria and integrates well


## Stage a model with Python API

- Run the script stage_model.py

```{python}
# Replace these placeholders with the appropriate values for your use case
MODEL_NAME = "IrisClassifier"
MODEL_VERSION = 3  # Replace with the desired version number
RUN_ID = "da22e09d42d94b0db3e7981e919d3b1d"
MODEL_URI = f"runs:/{RUN_ID}/model"

# Optional: Set the tracking URI to the local 'mlruns' folder (if not already set)
# mlflow.set_tracking_uri("file://" + os.path.abspath("mlruns"))

# Register the model
model_details = mlflow.register_model(MODEL_URI, MODEL_NAME)

# Get the model version
model_version = model_details.version

# Update the model version stage to "Staging"
mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient().transition_model_version_stage(
    name=MODEL_NAME,
    version=MODEL_VERSION,
    stage="Staging"
)


```


##

- To use a staged model, you'll first need to load the model from the MLflow Model Registry. 

- Here's how to load a model in the "Staging" stage:



```{python}

MODEL_NAME = "IrisClassifier"

staged_model = mlflow.sklearn.load_model(
    model_uri=f"models:/{MODEL_NAME}/Staging")

```


## Model Evaluation

- Assess model performance on validation/test dataset
- Calculate various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.)

##

```{python}


# Assuming you have X_test, y_test from your test dataset
y_pred = staged_model.predict(X_test)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))


```


## Cross-Validation

- Determine model's generalization capability
- Train and test the model on multiple folds

##

```{python}

# Assuming staged_model is your RandomForest classifier
cv_scores = cross_val_score(staged_model, X_train, y_train, cv=5)

print("Cross-Validation Scores:", cv_scores)
print("Mean CV Score:", cv_scores.mean())


```


## Feature Importance Analysis

- Analyze input feature importance
- Identify potential issues and improve the model

##

```{python}


# Assuming X is a NumPy array and staged_model is your RandomForest classifier
# Replace feature_names with your actual feature names, or use indices as feature names
feature_names = [f'Feature {i}' for i in range(X.shape[1])]

feature_importances = pd.Series(
    staged_model.feature_importances_, index=feature_names)
feature_importances.sort_values(ascending=True, inplace=True)

# Plotting feature importances using Pandas
ax = feature_importances.plot(kind='barh', figsize=(10, 5))
ax.set_title('Feature Importances')
ax.set_xlabel('Importance')
ax.set_ylabel('Features')

plt.show()


```

## Model Explanation

- Use SHAP values, LIME, or partial dependence plots
- Gain insights into the model's decision-making process

## Integration Testing

- Test model in a staging environment resembling production
- Ensure integration with other system components

##

```{python}

# Iris dataset class names
class_names = ['Setosa', 'Versicolor', 'Virginica']

# Example input data for the iris dataset: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
input_data = np.array([[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]])

prediction = staged_model.predict(input_data)

# Map the predicted class index to the corresponding class name
predicted_class = class_names[prediction[0]]

print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Predicted class:", predicted_class)


```

## Model Comparison

- Compare multiple models in the staging area
- Select the best one for production deployment

## Stakeholder Review

- Share model performance with stakeholders
- Gather feedback and ensure model meets project objectives


<!--

- Run the script `register_model.py` in the parent directory of mlruns:

```{python}

# Set the tracking URI if you are not using the default one
# mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://your_tracking_uri:port")

# Set the experiment you used for the run
mlflow.set_experiment("My Custom Experiment Name")

# Get the run_id for the run you want to register the model from
# Replace the id with your actual run ID of the successful run
your_run_id = "da22e09d42d94b0db3e7981e919d3b1d"

# Register the model
model_uri = f"runs:/{your_run_id}/model"
model_name = "IrisClassifier"
mlflow.register_model(model_uri, model_name)


```


## Using the MLflow UI


- Open the MLflow UI by running mlflow ui in your terminal (in the )

- navigating to http://localhost:5000.

- Find the experiment containing your successful run, and click on it.

- Locate the run with the trained model you want to register, and click on it.

- In the "Artifacts" section, find the model folder (or the folder you used to save the model), and click on "Register Model" next to it.

- Enter a name for the registered model, and click "Register".
